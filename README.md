# epbtools

python 3 script to parse Empyrion's EPB format

## NOTE! For Alpha 6.7 and higher only!

This python function parses Empyrion Galactic Survival's EPB format (in which the blueprints for ships and bases are stored). Its current capabilities are detailed below (including a few basic operations on the block data that are not well-supported yet):

### Current state

Currently, the script can retrieve:

* blueprint type
* blueprint size
* steam id and name for original creator
* steam id and name for current blueprinter
* number of lights
* number of devices
* total number of blocks
* number of triangles
* list of devices and blocks, and how many of each
* partial list of device groups, and their contents
* decompressed grid data (from PKZIP format)
* block position, damage state, color, texture, and symbol data extracted to 3D array

#### Block operation functions

* changeAllBlockProperty(property,newValue) : replaces the value of the specified property on *all* blocks in the grid
* changeAllBlockPropertyConditional(conditionProperty,conditionValue,property,newValue) : replaces the value of the specified property only on blocks that have a property with a certain value
* changeAllBlockFacePropertyConditional(conditionProperty,conditionValue,property,newValue) : replaces the value of the specified property only on the faces of blocks that have a property with a certain value
* listAllBlocks() : prints out the entire grid

### Missing functionality

* complete list of block ids and names
* significance of most bytes in the header (above the steam id section)
* extraction of device groups, and their contents
* extraction of signal logic
* miscellaneous unknown bytes throughout the file

## Usage

Just put

`from epbtools.readepb import readepb
from epbtools.writeepb import writeepb`

at the top of your file.

Call `readepb` like so:

`blueprint=readepb(filename)`

Call `writeepb` like so:

`writeepb(filename,blueprint)`

Use the block operations like so:

`blueprint.getProp("Grid").changeAllBlockPropertyConditional("Type",147,"Type",156)`
(replaces all "L Steel" blocks with "Combat Steel" blocks)

`blueprint.getProp("Grid").changeAllBlockFacePropertyConditional("Texture",1,"Texture",6)`
(replaces the new metal plate texture (texture 1) with the old metal plate texture (texture 6))

`blueprint.getProp("Grid").listAllBlocks()`
